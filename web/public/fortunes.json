The\n\tthreat of skunks or matrimony often catalyzes this reaction.\n\t\t-- Esquire, \"O'Donnell's Laws of Cartoon Motion\", June 1980",

For theirs is a strength born of things other than mere force.\nTheirs is a strength supreme... theirs is the strength -- to restore.\n\t\t-- Gerry Conway, \"Thor\", #193",
  "So Richard and I decided to try to catch [the small shark].\nWith a great deal of strategy and effort and shouting, we managed to\nmaneuver the shark, over the course of about a half-hour, to a sort of\ncorner of the lagoon, so that it had no way to escape other than to\nflop up onto the land and evolve.  Richard and I were inching toward\nit, sort of crouched over, when all of a sudden it turned around and --\nI can still remember the sensation I felt at that moment, primarily in\nthe armpit area -- headed right straight toward us.\n\tMany people would have panicked at this point.  But Richard and\nI were not \"many people.\"  We were experienced waders, and we kept our\nheads.  We did exactly what the textbook says you should do when you're\nunarmed and a shark that is nearly two feet long turns on you in water\nup to your lower calves: We sprinted I would say 600 yards in the\nopposite direction, using a sprinting style such that the bottoms of\nour feet never once went below the surface of the water.  We ran all\nthe way to the far shore, and if we had been in a Warner Brothers\ncartoon we would have run right INTO the beach, and you would have seen\nthese two mounds of sand racing across the island until they bonked\ninto trees and coconuts fell onto their heads.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"The Wonders of Sharks on TV\"",

  "The big problem with pornography is defining it.  You can't just\nsay it's pictures of people naked.  For example, you have these\nprimitive African tribes that exist by chasing the wildebeest on foot,\nand they have to go around largely naked, because, as the old tribal\nsaying goes: \"N'wam k'honi soit qui mali,\" which means, \"If you think\nyou can catch a wildebeest in this climate and wear clothes at the same\ntime, then I have some beach front property in the desert region of\nNorthern Mali that you may be interested in.\"\n\tSo it's not considered pornographic when National Geographic\npublishes color photographs of these people hunting the wildebeest\nnaked, or pounding one rock onto another rock for some primitive reason\nnaked, or whatever.

  "The Worst Musical Trio\n\tThere are few bad musicians who have a chance to give a recital at\na famous concert hall while still learning the rudiments of their\ninstrument.  This happened about thirty years ago to the son of a Rumanian\ngentleman who was owed a personal favour by Georges Enesco, the celebrated\nviolinist.  Enesco agreed to give lessons to the son who was quite\nunhampered by great musical talent.\n\tThree years later the boy's father insisted that he give a public\nconcert.  \"His aunt said that nobody plays the violin better than he does.\nA cousin heard him the other day and screamed with enthusiasm.\"  Although\nEnesco feared the consequences, he arranged a recital at the Salle Gaveau\nin Paris.  However, nobody bought a ticket since the soloist was unknown.\n\t\"Then you must accompany him on the piano,\" said the boy's father,\n\"and it will be a sell out.\"\n\tReluctantly, Enesco agreed and it was.  On the night an excited\naudience gathered.  Before the concert began Enesco became nervous and\nasked for someone to turn his pages.\n\tIn the audience was Alfred Cortot, the brilliant pianist, who\nvolunteered and made his way to the stage.\n\tThe soloist was of uniformly low standard and next morning the\nmusic critic of Le Figaro wrote: \"There was a strange concert at the Salle\nGaveau last night.  The man whom we adore when he plays the violin played\nthe piano.  Another whom we adore when he plays the piano turned the pages.\nBut the man who should have turned the pages played the violin.\"\n\t\t-- Stephen Pile, \"The Book of Heroic Failures\"",

It's hard to\nrecognize that life isn't a holding action, but a process.  It's hard to\nlearn that we don't leave the best parts of ourselves behind, back in the\ndugout or the office.

He says that smoke is the thing\nthat makes ICs work because every time you let the smoke out of an IC circuit,\nit stops working.

It's the wiring harness that carries the smoke from one device to\nanother in your Mini, MG or Jag.  And when the harness springs a leak, it lets\nthe smoke out of everything at once, and then nothing works.  The starter motor\nrequires large quantities of smoke to operate properly, and that's why the wire\ngoing to it is so large.\n\tFeeling very smug, I continued to expand my hypothesis.

  "Ever wondered about the origins of the term \"bugs\" as applied to computer\ntechnology?  U.S. Navy Capt. Grace Murray Hopper has firsthand explanation.\nThe 74-year-old captain, who is still on active duty, was a pioneer in \ncomputer technology during World War II.  At the C.W. Post Center of Long\nIsland University, Hopper told a group of Long Island public school adminis-\ntrators that the first computer \"bug\" was a real bug--a moth.  At Harvard\none August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were working on the\n\"granddaddy\" of modern computers, the Mark I.  \"Things were going badly;\nthere was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long glass-enclosed\ncomputer,\" she said.  \"Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using\nordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth.  From then on, when\nanything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it.\"  Hopper\nsaid that when the veracity of her story was questioned recently, \"I referred\nthem to my 1945 log book, now in the collection of the Naval Surface Weapons\nCenter, and they found the remains of that moth taped to the page in\nquestion.\"\n\t\t[actually, the term \"bug\" had even earlier usage in\n\t\tregard to problems with radio hardware.

  "Fellow programmer, greetings!  You are reading a letter which will bring\nyou luck and good fortune.  Just mail (or UUCP) ten copies of this letter\nto ten of your friends.  Before you make the copies, send a chip or\nother bit of hardware, and 100 lines of 'C' code to the first person on the\nlist given at the bottom of this letter.  Then delete their name and add\nyours to the bottom of the list.\n\nDon't break the chain!  Make the copy within 48 hours.  Gerald R. of San\nDiego failed to send out his ten copies and woke the next morning to find\nhis job description changed to \"COBOL programmer.\"  Fred A. of New York sent\nout his ten copies and within a month had enough hardware and software to\nbuild a Cray dedicated to playing Zork.  Martha H. of Chicago laughed at\nthis letter and broke the chain.  Shortly thereafter, a fire broke out in\nher terminal and she now spends her days writing documentation for IBM PC's.\n\nDon't break the chain!  Send out your ten copies today!\nFor example, if \\thinmskip = 3mu, this makes \\thickmskip = 6mu.  But if\nyou also want to use \\skip12 for horizontal glue, whether in math mode or\nnot, the amount of skipping will be in points (e.g., 6pt).  The rule is\nthat glue in math mode varies with the size only when it is an \\mskip;\nwhen moving between an mskip and ordinary skip, the conversion factor\n1mu=1pt is always used.

I'm not talking about ordinary modular programming\ncarefulness here.  No.  Programming an imbedded system calls for undiluted\nraging maniacal paranoia.  For example, our ethernet front ends need to know\nwhat network number they are on so that they can address and route PUPs\nproperly.  How do you find out what your network number is?  Easy, you ask a\ngateway.  Gateways are required by definition to know their correct network\nnumbers.  Once you've got your network number, you start using it and before\nyou can blink you've got it wired into fifteen different sockets spread all\nover creation.  Now what happens when the panic-stricken operator realizes he\nwas running the wrong version of the gateway which was giving out the wrong\nnetwork number?  Never supposed to happen.  Tough.  Supposing that your\nsoftware discovers that the gateway is now giving out a different network\nnumber than before, what's it supposed to do about it?  This is not discussed\nin the protocol document.  Never supposed to happen.  Tough.  I think you \nget my drift.",

  "Norbert Weiner was the subject of many dotty professor stories.  Weiner was, in\nfact, very absent minded.  The following story is told about him: when they\nmoved from Cambridge to Newton his wife, knowing that he would be absolutely\nuseless on the move, packed him off to MIT while she directed the move.  Since\nshe was certain that he would forget that they had moved and where they had\nmoved to, she wrote down the new address on a piece of paper, and gave it to\nhim.  Naturally, in the course of the day, an insight occurred to him.  He\nreached in his pocket, found a piece of paper on which he furiously scribbled\nsome notes, thought it over, decided there was a fallacy in his idea, and\nthrew the piece of paper away.  At the end of the day he went home (to the\nold address in Cambridge, of course).  When he got there he realized that they\nhad moved, that he had no idea where they had moved to, and that the piece of\npaper with the address was long gone.  Fortunately inspiration struck.  There\nwas a young girl on the street and he conceived the idea of asking her where\nhe had moved to, saying, \"Excuse me, perhaps you know me.  I'm Norbert Weiner\nand we've just moved.  Would you know where we've moved to?\"  To which the\nyoung girl replied, \"Yes, Daddy, Mommy thought you would forget.\"\n\tThe capper to the story is that I asked his daughter (the girl in the\nstory) about the truth of the story, many years later.  She said that it wasn't\nquite true -- that he never forgot who his children were!  The rest of it,\nhowever, was pretty close to what actually happened...\n\t\t-- Richard Harter",

Ten percent of our\nVAXs are going for UNIX use.  UNIX is a simple language, easy to understand,\neasy to get started with. It's great for students, great for somewhat casual\nusers, and it's great for interchanging programs between different machines.\nAnd so, because of its popularity in these markets, we support it.  We have\ngood UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.\n\tIt is our belief, however, that serious professional users will run\nout of things they can do with UNIX. They'll want a real system and will end\nup doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.\n\tWith UNIX, if you're looking for something, you can easily and quickly\ncheck that small manual and find out that it's not there.  With VMS, no matter\nwhat you look for -- it's literally a five-foot shelf of documentation -- if\nyou look long enough it's there.  That's the difference -- the beauty of UNIX\nis it's simple; and the beauty of VMS is that it's all there.\n\t\t-- Ken Olsen, president of DEC, DECWORLD Vol. 8 No. 5, 1984\n[It's been argued that the beauty of UNIX is the same as the beauty of Ken\nOlsen's brain.

  "SEMINAR ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nTitle:\t\tAre Frogs Turing Compatible?\nSpeaker:\tDon \"The Lion\" Knuth\n\n\t\t\t\tABSTRACT\n\tSeveral researchers at the University of Louisiana have been studying\nthe computing power of various amphibians, frogs in particular.  The problem\nof frog computability has become a critical issue that ranges across all areas\nof computer science.  It has been shown that anything computable by an amphi-\nbian community in a fixed-size pond is computable by a frog in the same-size\npond -- that is to say, frogs are Pond-space complete.  We will show that\nthere is a log-space, polywog-time reduction from any Turing machine program\nto a frog.  We will suggest these represent a proper subset of frog-computable\nfunctions.\n\tThis is not just a let's-see-how-far-those-frogs-can-jump seminar.\nThis is only for hardcore amphibian-computation people and their colleagues.\n\tRefreshments will be served.  Music will be played.",

  "***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)\n\nIt has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge \nin order to perform well in complex domains.  But knowledge alone is not\nsufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly, \nwe have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call \n\"wisdom engineering\".  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a \nwisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.  \nIMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom \nabout such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so \nforth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic \nrules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL \nsucceeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed \nin western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those \nunderlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory\nof value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe \nIMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly \ndiscuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.",

The official\nbrewer has released the recipe, and a lot of home-brewers now use it.\n\tHurd beer: Long advertised by the popular and politically active\nGNU brewery, so far it has more head than body.  The GNU brewery is\nmostly known for printing complete brewing instructions on every can,\nwhich contains hops, malt, barley, and yeast ... not yet fermented.\n\tLinux brand: A recipe originally created by a drunken Finn in his\nbasement, it has since become the home-brew of choice for impecunious\nbrewers and Unix beer-lovers worldwide, many of whom change the recipe.\n\tPOSIX ales: Sweeter than lager, with the kick of a stout; the\nnewer batches of a lot of beers seem to blend ale and stout or lager.\n\tSolaris brand: A lager, intended to replace Sun brand stout.\nUnlike most lagers, this one has to be drunk more slowly than stout.\n\tSun brand: Long the most popular stout on the Unix market, it was\ndiscontinued in favor of a lager.\n\tSysV lager: Clear and thirst-quenching, but lacking the body of\nstout or the sweetness of ale.",

He asserted that they could prepare\nthe specifications, with the architecture team coordinating; it would be \nwell-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.  Futhermore, if\nthe architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling their thumbs\nfor ten months.\n\nTo this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control program\nteam the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time, but would\nalso be three months late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and it was.  He\nwas right on both counts.  Moreover, the lack of conceptual integrity made\nthe system far more costly to build and change, and I would estimate that it\nadded a year to debugging time.\n- Frederick Brooks Jr., \"The Mythical Man Month\"",

Something happens between first and twelfth grade,\nand it's not just puberty.  Not only do the schools and the media not teach\nmuch skepticism, there is also little encouragement of this stirring sense\nof wonder.  Science and pseudoscience both arouse that feeling.

Others view it as nothing\nbut a cold, dry narrow, plodding, rule-bound process -- the scientific\nmethod: hidebound, linear, and left brained.\n\nThese people are the victims of their own stereotypes.  They are\ndestined to view the world of science with a set of blinders.  They\nknow nothing of the tumult, cacophony, rambunctiousness, and \ntendentiousness of the actual scientific process, let alone the \ncreativity, passion, and joy of discovery.

This time it was stargazing that became a serious issue....Not\nthat long ago, it was Reagan's support of Creationism....Creationists actually\ngot equal time with evolutionists.  The public was supposed to be open-minded\nto the claims of paleontologists and fundamentalists, as if the two were\nscientific colleagues....It has been clear for a long time that the president\nis averse to science...In general, these attitudes fall onto friendly American\nturf....But at the outer edges, this skepticism about science easily turns\ninto a kind of naive acceptance of nonscience, or even nonsense.

  "[Astrology is] 100 percent hokum, Ted.  As a matter of fact, the first edition\nof the Encyclopaedia Britannica, written in 1771 -- 1771! -- said that this\nbelief system is a subject long ago ridiculed and reviled.  We're dealing with\nbeliefs that go back to the ancient Babylonians.  There's nothing there....\nIt sounds a lot like science, it sounds like astronomy.  It's got technical\nterms.  It's got jargon.  It confuses the public....The astrologer is quite\nglib, confuses the public, uses terms which come from science, come from\nmetaphysics, come from a host of fields, but they really mean nothing.  The\nfact is that astrological beliefs go back at least 2,500 years.  Now that\nshould be a sufficiently long time for astrologers to prove their case.  They\nhave not proved their case....It's just simply gibberish.  The fact is, there's\nno theory for it, there are no observational data for it.  It's been tested\nand tested over the centuries.  Nobody's ever found any validity to it at\nall.  It is not even close to a science.  A science has to be repeatable, it\nhas to have a logical foundation, and it has to be potentially vulnerable --\nyou test it.

  "Even if we put all these nagging thoughts [four embarrassing questions about\nastrology] aside for a moment, one overriding question remains to be asked.\nWhy would the positions of celestial objects at the moment of birth have an\neffect on our characters, lives, or destinies?  What force or influence,\nwhat sort of energy would travel from the planets and stars to all human\nbeings and affect our development or fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding\njargon or computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise this central\nproblem with astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which\ncelestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .\nSome astrologers argue that there may be a still unknown force that represents\nthe astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like those\nof any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always\nclaim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of their\nefficacy, so in the last two decades scientists and statisticians have\ngenerously done such testing for them.  There have been dozens of well-designed\ntests all around the world, and astrology has failed every one of them. . . .\nI propose that we let those beckoning lights in the sky awaken our interest\nin the real (and fascinating) universe beyond our planet, and not let them\nkeep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by\nthe firelight, afraid of the night.\n-- Andrew Fraknoi, Executive Officer, Astronomical Society of the Pacific,\n    \"Why Astrology Believers Should Feel Embarrassed,\" San Jose Mercury\n    News, May 8, 1988",
  "With the news that Nancy Reagan has referred to an astrologer when planning\nher husband's schedule, and reports of Californians evacuating Los Angeles\non the strength of a prediction from a sixteenth-century physician and\nastrologer Michel de Notredame, the image of the U.S. as a scientific and\ntechnological nation has taking a bit of a battering lately.  Sadly, such\nhappenings cannot be dismissed as passing fancies.  They are manifestations\nof a well-established \"anti-science\" tendency in the U.S. which, ultimately,\ncould threaten the country's position as a technological power. . . .  The\nmanifest widespread desire to reject rationality and substitute a series\nof quasirandom beliefs in order to understand the universe does not augur\nwell for a nation deeply concerned about its ability to compete with its\nindustrial equals.  To the degree that it reflects the thinking of a \nsignificant section of the public, this point of view encourages ignorance\nof and, indeed, contempt for science and for rational methods of approaching\ntruth. . . . It is becoming clear that if the U.S. does not pick itself up\nsoon and devote some effort to educating the young effectively, its hope of\nmaintaining a semblance of leadership in the world may rest, paradoxically,\nwith a new wave of technically interested and trained immigrants who do not\nsuffer from the anti-science disease rampant in an apparently decaying society.\n-- Physicist Tony Feinberg, in \"New Scientist,\" May 19, 1988",

I even forbade myself the use \nof every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion, \nsuch as \"certainly\", \"undoubtedly\", etc.   I adopted instead of them \"I \nconceive\", \"I apprehend\", or \"I imagine\" a thing to be so or so; or \"so it \nappears to me at present\".\n\nWhen another asserted something that I thought an error, I denied myself the \npleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing him immediately some \nabsurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began by observing that in \ncertain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present\ncase there appeared or semed to me some difference, etc.\n\nI soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I \nengaged in went on more pleasantly.  The modest way in which I proposed my \nopinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction.  I had \nless mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily \nprevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I \nhappened to be in the right.\n-- Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin",

Pull one of these\n\thorses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all\n\tof these horses are the same color.

  "RULES OF EATING -- THE BRONX DIETER'S CREED\n\t(1)  Never eat on an empty stomach.\n\t(2)  Never leave the table hungry.\n\t(3)  When traveling, never leave a country hungry.\n\t(4)  Enjoy your food.\n\t(5)  Enjoy your companion's food.\n\t(6)  Really taste your food.  It may take several portions to\n\t     accomplish this, especially if subtly seasoned.\n\t(7)  Really feel your food.  Texture is important.  Compare,\n\t     for example, the texture of a turnip to that of a\n\t     brownie.  Which feels better against your cheeks?\n\t(8)  Never eat between snacks, unless it's a meal.\n\t(9)  Don't feel you must finish everything on your plate.  You\n\t     can always eat it later.\n\t(10) Avoid any wine with a childproof cap.\n\t(11) Avoid blue food.\n\t\t-- Richard Smith, \"The Bronx Diet\"",

These laws were written down sometime in the\n13th century, but date back even down into Viking times.  The oldest one is\nthe Vastgota law which clearly has pagan influences, thinly covered with some\nChristian stuff.  In this law, we find a page about \"lekare\", which is the\nOld Norse word for a performing artist, actor/jester/musician etc.  Here is\nan approximate translation, where I have written \"artist\" as equivalent of\n\"lekare\".\n\t\"If an artist is beaten, none shall pay fines for it.  If an artist\n\tis wounded, one such who goes with hurdie-gurdie or travels with\n\tfiddle or drum, then the people shall take a wild heifer and bring\n\tit out on the hillside.  Then they shall shave off all hair from the\n\theifer's tail, and grease the tail.  Then the artist shall be given\n\tnewly greased shoes.  Then he shall take hold of the heifer's tail,\n\tand a man shall strike it with a sharp whip.  If he can hold her, he\n\tshall have the animal.  If he cannot hold her, he shall endure what\n\the received, shame and wounds.\"",

But is drug testing in fact rationally related to the\nresurrection of competitiveness?  Will charging the atmosphere of the\nworkplace with the fear of excretory betrayal honestly spur productivity?\nMuch noise has been made about rehabilitating the worker using drugs, but\nto date the vast majority of programs end with the simple firing or the not\nhiring of the abuser.

  "A sharper perspective on this matter is particularly important to feminist\nthought today, because a major tendency in feminism has constructed the\nproblem of domination as a drama of female vulnerability victimized by male\naggression.  Even the more sophisticated feminist thinkers frequently shy\naway from the analysis of submission, for fear that in admitting woman's\nparticipation in the relationship of domination, the onus of responsibility\nwill appear to shift from men to women, and the moral victory from women to\nmen.  More generally, this has been a weakness of radical politics: to\nidealize the oppressed, as if their politics and culture were untouched by\nthe system of domination, as if people did not participate in their own\nsubmission.  To reduce domination to a simple relation of doer and done-to\nis to substitute moral outrage for analysis.\n\t\t-- Jessica Benjamin, \"The Bonds of Love\"",

  "The Least Successful Executions\n\tHistory has furnished us with two executioners worthy of attention.\nThe first performed in Sydney in Australia.  In 1803 three attempts were\nmade to hang a Mr. Joseph Samuels.  On the first two of these the rope\nsnapped, while on the third Mr. Samuels just hung there peacefully until he\nand everyone else got bored.  Since he had proved unsusceptible to capital\npunishment, he was reprieved.\n\tThe most important British executioner was Mr. James Berry who\ntried three times in 1885 to hang Mr. John Lee at Exeter Jail, but on each\noccasion failed to get the trap door open.\n\tIn recognition of this achievement, the Home Secretary commuted\nLee's sentence to \"life\" imprisonment.

I got sick and tired of doing that dog's work for him.\"\n\tThe British contenders in this category, however, took things a\nstage further.  \"Laddie\" and \"Boy\" were trained as detector dogs for drug\nraids.  Their employment was terminated following a raid in the Midlands in\n1967.\n\tWhile the investigating officer questioned two suspects, they\npatted and stroked the dogs who eventually fell asleep in front of the\nfire.

Another versatile equation also emerged, one which would define\na function that would continue to grow, but never reach unity.  This equation\ncan be applied to charging capacitors, over-damped springs, and the human\nrace in general.",

Put things back where you found them.  Clean up your own mess.\nDon't take things that aren't yours.   Say you're sorry when you hurt someone.\nWash your hands before you eat.  Flush.  Warm cookies and cold milk are good\nfor you.  Live a balanced life.  Learn some and think some and draw and paint\nand sing and dance and play and work some every day.\n\tTake a nap every afternoon.  When you go out into the world, watch for\ntraffic, hold hands, and stick together.  Be aware of wonder.  Remember the\nlittle seed in the plastic cup.   The roots go down and the plant goes up and\nnobody really knows how or why, but we are all like that.  Goldfish and\nhamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the plastic cup -- they all\ndie.  So do we.\n\tAnd then remember the book about Dick and Jane and the first word you\nlearned, the biggest word of all: LOOK.  Everything you need to know is in\nthere somewhere.  The Golden Rule and love and basic sanitation.  Ecology and\npolitics and sane living.\n\tThink of what a better world it would be if we all -- the whole world\n-- had cookies and milk about 3 o'clock every afternoon and then lay down with\nour blankets for a nap.  Or if we had a basic policy in our nation and other\nnations to always put things back where we found them and cleaned up our own\nmesses.  And it is still true, no matter how old you are, when you go out into\nthe world it is best to hold hands and stick together.\n\t\t-- Robert Fulghum, \"All I ever really needed to know I learned\n\t\t   in kindergarten\"",

And the next day, and the\none after that, and so forth.  This grated on the bus driver, who started\nlosing sleep over the way Big John was taking advantage of him.  Finally he\ncould stand it no longer. He signed up for bodybuilding courses, karate, judo,\nand all that good stuff.  By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong;\nwhat's more, he felt really good about himself.\n\tSo on the next Monday, when Big John once again got on the bus\nand said \"Big John doesn't pay!,\" the driver stood up, glared back at the\npassenger, and screamed, \"And why not?\"\n\tWith a surprised look on his face, Big John replied, \"Big John has a\nbus pass.\"",

  "One promising concept that I came up with right away was that you could\nmanufacture personal air bags, then get a law passed requiring that they be\ninstalled on congressmen to keep them from taking trips.  Let's say your\ncongressman was trying to travel to Paris to do a fact-finding study on how\nthe French government handles diseases transmitted by sherbet.  Just when he\ngot to the plane, his mandatory air bag, strapped around his waist, would\ninflate -- FWWAAAAAAPPPP -- thus rendering him too large to fit through the\nplane door.  It could also be rigged to inflate whenever the congressman\nproposed a law.  (\"Mr. Speaker, people ask me, why should October be\ndesignated as Cuticle Inspection Month?  And I answer that FWWAAAAAAPPPP.\")\nThis would save millions of dollars, so I have no doubt that the public\nwould violently support a law requiring airbags on congressmen.
